# ReminderBot

ReminderBot is a command-line tool written in Go that allows users to set reminders for various tasks or events. It provides a simple and convenient way to manage and be reminded of important deadlines, appointments, birthdays, and more.

## Features

- Task Creation: Users can create reminders by providing a task description, due date/time, and optional tags or labels to categorize the reminders.
- Task Listing: Users can view a list of all the reminders they have set, sorted by due date/time, and filtered by tags or labels.
- Task Notification: The ReminderBot sends notifications to users when a reminder is due, either via the terminal, email, or chat message, depending on the chosen interface.
- Task Editing: Users can edit existing reminders, such as updating the task description, due date/time, or tags.
- Task Deletion: Users can delete reminders when they are no longer needed.
- Task Snoozing: Users can snooze reminders to be reminded again after a certain period of time if they are not ready to complete the - task yet.
- Task Search: Users can search for reminders by keywords, due date/time, or tags to quickly locate specific reminders.
- Task Persistence: The ReminderBot stores reminders in a database or file system to ensure that reminders persist across sessions and system restarts.
- User Authentication: Optionally, the ReminderBot can implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own set of reminders with proper access control.
- Configurable Settings: Users can configure settings such as notification preferences, time zones, and other preferences to customize the ReminderBot to their liking.
